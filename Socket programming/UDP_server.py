'''
The below line binds (that is, assigns) the port number 12000 to the serverâ€™s socket.
Thus, in UDPServer, the code (written by the application developer) is explicitly
assigning a port number to the socket. In this manner, when anyone sends a packet to
port 12000 at the IP address of the server, that packet will be directed to this socket.
UDPServer then enters a while loop; the while loop will allow UDPServer to receive
and process packets from clients indefinitely. In the while loop, UDPServer waits for
a packet to arrive.
